# Palindrome Project 

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards (ie: racecar, 112211).

# Description 

A python based algorithm that given a string representing an integer, returns the nearest palindrome outside of itself as a string. 

**Example...**

Input: n = '123'    

Output: '121'

This project is a Junior Software Developer Challenge that is part of an interview procress.
